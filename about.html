	<img class="me" src="me.jpg">
	<p>I am <b>Anastasiia Danilovska</b> – an aspiring literature critic, who runs an academic writing 
	agency. Studying at three universities in three different countries such as Ukraine, 
	Lithuania and Hungary provided me with deep understanding of various educational systems.</p>
	<p>I have been studying academic writing for more than three years and since then I have gone through 
	different stages of relationships with the subject. <b>“Essay Crisis”</b> is the writing agency, 
	which I created in order to help students who struggle with their academic papers. </p>
	<p>My areas of expertise include <b>Literary Studies, Film Studies</b> and <b>Linguistics</b>. 
	Clarity, quality and attention to detail constitute the philosophy of my work. 
	Understanding main principles, structure and stages of writing academic 
	papers helped me to master my writing. Therefore, I would like to help other s
	tudents and share my knowledge with them. </p>
